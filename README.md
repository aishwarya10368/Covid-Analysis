# Covid-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data through SQL and visualizing the findings in Tableau. Using datasets on COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations, SQL queries generate insights such as total cases, death rates, and vaccination coverage across different regions. The results are then displayed in an interactive Tableau dashboard, providing users with the ability to explore trends and compare data across countries. By illustrating the correlation between vaccination rates and infection outcomes, the project emphasizes the importance of vaccination in mitigating the pandemic's impact.
